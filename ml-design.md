# ML Design

Tackling the ML design interview.

## Problem Definition

- Define the ultimate goal.
  - Example: "Increase user engagement"
- Define proxy events, and business metrics based on them that can measure our progress.
  - Example: "sessions per week", "session length", "click-through rate", "revenue" (for ads), etc.
  - We could even create a "not relevant" button to gather negative user-feedbacks.
