Key points to note:

- Our eyes have 3 types of cone photoreceptors: Long (reds), Medium (greens) and Short (blues)
- 1924 Luminous Efficiency Function V(Î») represents the spectral sensitivity of human visual perception. It shows how the perceived brightness varies relatively to equally-radiant light sources differing in wavelengths.
- The perception of color from a light composed of a single wavelength ("pure") is called a spectral color.
  - Note: We rarely see spectral colors. A color-perception produced by a mixture of different wavelengths is almost never a spectral color. Such colors that can only be formed by a mixture of "monochromatic" lights are called non-spectral colors (e.g. white/grey).
  - Side note: The visible spectrum is not represented by the range of colors, but the range of wavelengths.
- 1931 RGB Color Matching Functions (RGB CMFs) shows how one could pereptually match any spectral color using a mixture of 3 light sources of fixed wavelengths: red (700 nm), green (546.1 nm) and blue (435.8 nm).
  - Note that at 500 nm, the contribution of red is negative. This means, to match the perception of color from a 500 nm wavelength light source (the reference), the red component had to mixed with the reference light (!!) in order to make a match (i.e., 0.08 "green" + 0.05 "blue" = L "500 nm" + 0.06 "red", where L is the luminosity of the reference light)
- Tristimulus values: (kinda) the luminosity of primary lights (R G B) needed to make a color-perception match.
- Chromaticity values: (kinda) tristimulus values normalized on luminosity (or intensity), such that the 3 individual components add up to `1.0`. This can now be projected on to a 2D plane (say the red-green plane) without loss of information since the 3rd value is determinable from the other two.
- Spectral locus: The line formed by the spectral colors on the chromaticity space.
  - If we draw a straight line between any two points on the spectral locus, all points in that straight line is a "realizable" color. Points that are "outside" this surface enclosed by the spectral locus are "non-realizable" (imaginary)!
  - Pick any 3 points on the spectral locus. The area inside the triangle formed by those points are realizable using light sources of only those 3 wavelengths.
- CIE XYZ color space is a linear transformation of the RGB color space in order to bring all realizable chromaticities to have positive component values, and have the Y component's CMF closely match the Luminous Efficiency Function.
