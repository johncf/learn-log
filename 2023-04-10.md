### Paper: G. E. Hinton et. al.: Transforming Auto-encoders (2011)

Link: <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/transauto6.pdf>

A discussion paper about apparent fundamental limitations of CNN layers, and how to overcome it using a new type of layer called "capsule".
This is interesting in that it should result in a model that is interpretable by design, but it requires specialized training data, which would be fairly easy to render and generate synthetically, but very difficult to label on real-world pictures.
Only provides a high-level and abstract discussion, without going into technical details of implementation, nor providing any concrete results or limitations.

Provides a high-level view to get an appreciation for the work.
Doesn't go into much technical details, especially about how they efficiently update the graph edges as the system evolves and particles move around so as to facilitate inter-particle interactions.
The interview with Jonathan Godwin also remains high-level, but does point out that the model's weakness is in simulating large rigid bodies, as graph networks struggle to pass information between two ends of a large rigid body quickly enough.

A video with great visualizations to get a mathematical appreciation of the subject.
Also gives a teaser on how FFT can be used to speed up this operation, with links to other great videos.
