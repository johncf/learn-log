## Software Engineering

### Software Development Lifecycle

1. Exploration phase:
   - Brainstorm ideas, set goals, identify risks
   - Functional specifications: project and scope; use-cases and non-goals; assumptions, risks and feasibility; possible solutions and requirements; defining milestones, etc.
   - Data exploration; quick prototyping etc.
1. Design phase: use case diagram, API design, API sequence diagrams, class diagrams, database design etc.
1. Implementation phase: parallel implementation of various parts, with unit tests
1. Quality check phase: writing extensive integration tests, verification
1. Deployment phase: ensure proper monitoring, updateability, backups, revertibility etc.

Different project management aproaches:

- **Waterfall model**: go through each phase, one at a time, in-detail. Slow deliveries, and may not keep up with changing requirements.
- **Agile model**: very short design phase; prototyping and implementation may happen simultaneously; short quality check phase. Fast deliveries, but possibly more maintenance cost due to higher chances of bugs and inflexible design decisions
- **Iterative model**: divide the project into several small deliverable milestones. Faster deliveries and user feedback opportunities. May need clever simplifications; may not always be possible to design a small deliverable for each step.
- **Spiral model**: similar to iterative model?
