# Coding Interview

Tackling the coding interview.

## Evaluation Criterion

1. **Communication**. Ask for requirements and clarifications as necessary. Don't dive into the code, and instead make it a conversation.
1. **Problem solving**. Ability to comprehend and explain complex ideas. Provide the reasoning behind a particular solution. Develop and compare multiple solutions. Use appropriate data structures. Analyze space and time complexity. Optimize your solution.
1. **Coding**. Ability to convert solutions to executable code. Write well-organized code that captures the logical structure correctly.
1. **Verification**. Consider a reasonable number of test cases or come up with a good argument for why your code is correct. Ability to explain what the code does, and walk through the logic, while finding any bugs along the way.

## Steps for Success

Total time: 15-20 minutes

- Understand the problem. (finish by 2-4 minutes in)
  - Misunderstanding the problem will cost you dearly! So make sure you get the problem straight.
  - Take non-trivial examples, and make sure the expected output is what you expected!
  - Ask for clarifications, and input/output constraints (e.g., input size, input/output types, corner cases etc.)
  - If the problem is not algorithmic (e.g., "Build a csv parser"), make sure to discuss the use-cases, and come up with an appropriate data representation (e.g., row-wise vs. column-wise grouping).
- Think out loud, while planning your approach. (finish by 6-10 minutes in)
  - This is important, as it helps your interviewer follow along, learn about your reasons for _not_ considering various approaches, _and_ provide hints if needed.
  - State the expected time and space complexity of the approaches while you consider them.
  - When you arrive at a solution, be sure to get the interviewer's thoughts on it before you start coding.
- Write a working solution and iterate. (finish by 12-16 minutes in)
  - Better to have a non-optimal but working solution than get lost in the pursuit of optimality.
  - If your interviewer expresses doubts on a certain part of the code, they're likely hinting at an opportunity to improve your code, so don't ignore them!
  - Ask clarifying questions about constraints/assumptions as you go along.
  - Suggest ways to optimize your code and get feedback before coding it up, to ensure what you're trying to do is correct and not overly complex.
  - If your solution is getting messy, step back. Most interview questions are designed to have reasonably elegant solutions. Look for patterns that could be generalized.
- Run through the code verbally, with an example. (finish by 15-20 minutes in)
  - Test your code, put in an input to see what happens.
  - Make sure to read what is there, not what you think is there.
  - It's good if you find bugs and fix them yourself!
- Restate the complexity. (Optional if it's still the same, or due lack of time.)
  - Is it different from your initial expectations after you have implemented?

## More Tips

- Restate the problem as you see it if it helps clarify things.
- Do not jump straight into coding!
- It is totally okay to ask for hints if you're stuck.
- Start with the basic approach -- brute-force -- but don't code!
- State/analyze the time _and_ space complexity of every approach
- While coding, be sure to modularize so that it's easy to focus on the interesting parts
- Ensure edge-cases are covered
