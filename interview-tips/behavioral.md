# Behavioral Interview

Tackling the behavioral interview.

## Evaluation Criterion

The aim of this interview is to evaluate the candidate's communication skills, self-awareness, conflict-resolution approach, leadership skills, work-style and alignment with company-culture. Most importantly, they try to find if a candidate raises any red-flags (e.g., dishonesty) or is unable to provide any good signal.

## General Tips

Be prepared with the following:

- A 2-minute summary of your career.
- Why you want to join the company.
- Why you chose to leave the current/previous one.
- Your strengths and weaknesses.
- What you find interesting in your current role (or in your field).
- How you manage your time, schedule tasks, and handle deadlines.
- The details of a project that you worked on that aligns with your interests, including the journey and key challenges you faced.
- An example of a past conflict with a colleague, and how you resolved it.
- An example of a past failure/mistake, and how you handled it.
- An example of a criticism that you got, and how you received it.

## Red Flags

- Don't be dishonest! Be genuine.
- Do not portray yourself as being perfect. Be open about your limitations and making mistakes.
