# Behavioral Interview

Tackling the behavioral interview.

## Evaluation Criterion

The aim of this interview is to evaluate the candidate's leadership skills, self-awareness, conflict-resolution approach, ability to handle ambiguity and communication skills. Importantly, they try to find if a candidate raises any red-flags or is unable to provide any good signal.

## General Tips

Be prepared with the following:

- A 2-minute summary of your career.
- Your strengths and weaknesses.
- Why you want to join the company.
- Why you chose to leave the current/previous one.
- An example of a past conflict with a colleague, and how you resolved it.
- How you manage your time, schedule tasks, and handle deadlines.
- What you find interesting in your current role (or in your field).

## Red Flags

- Do not portray yourself as being perfect. Be open about your limitations and making mistakes.
