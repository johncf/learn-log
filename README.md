# learn-log

This repo is aimed to summarize my learnings as I discover and/or dig into new topics, or just to serve as a history of interesting articles that I find around the internet.

At the moment, topics will be limited to the field of machine learning for the most part.

- See [ml-concepts.md](./ml-concepts.md) for a quick summary of certain concepts.
- See [software-engineering.md](./software-engineering.md) for some notes on software/model development lifecycles.
- See [worklog-template.md](./worklog-template.md) for a template to organize and log your daily work.

Here is a list of interesting places to discover interesting developments, or great explainer articles:
- [State of AI Report](https://www.stateof.ai/) - A good yearly summary of major developments in the field of AI
- [Distill](https://distill.pub/) - A collection of great explainer articles with amazing visualizations
- [r/ml What are you Reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/vg5kjd/d_machine_learning_wayr_what_are_you_reading_week/) - A collection of (possibly archived) threads in machine learning subreddit that discuss interesting papers (no longer active)
- [Chris Olah's blog](http://colah.github.io/) - One of Distill authors' blog, with similar articles
- [Import AI](https://jack-clark.net/) - A weekly newsletter about AI, from the POV of one person
- [Guide to AI](https://nathanbenaich.substack.com/) - From the same author(s) of State of AI Report (but a bit noisy)
