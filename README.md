This repo is aimed to summarize my learnings as I discover and/or dig into new topics, or just to serve as a history of interesting articles that I find around the internet.

At the moment, topics will be limited to the field of machine learning.
See [ml-concepts.md](./ml-concepts.md) for a quick summary of certain concepts.
