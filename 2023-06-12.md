### SafeTensors

A safe file format that is planned (by Huggingface) to become the default for all pretrained model distribution needs.
Besides being safe, it has several features that (esp.) large models can benefit from. See comparison link below.

### tinygrad

A deep learning framework focusing on internal simplicity, with PyTorch-like API.
The interesting part is -- the company behind this, the tiny corp, aims to end NVIDIA's monopoly on AI hardware, by writing better software (drivers, APIs etc.) for AMD GPUs! (No, they're not making their own chips.)
