### Confidence estimation

- Estimate the probability that the model's prediction is indeed correct.
- Straightforward in the case of classification problems where each class gets a number associated with it.
  - A softmax on the logits can map the values into a sensible range, but are they representative of the underlying probability of model correctness? Most often not.
- We may assess the correctness of our confidence estimates using a calibration plot (a.k.a reliability diagram).
- We may improve the correctness of our confidence estimates using various calibration techniques such as Platt scaling and Isotonic regression.
