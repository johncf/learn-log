### Confidence Estimation

- Estimate the probability that the model's prediction is indeed correct.
- Straightforward in the case of classification problems where each class gets a number associated with it.
  - A softmax on the logits can map the values into a sensible range, but are they representative of the underlying probability of model correctness? Most often not.
- We may assess the correctness of our confidence estimates using a calibration plot (a.k.a reliability diagram).
- We may improve the correctness of our confidence estimates using various calibration techniques such as Platt scaling and Isotonic regression.

### MLOps Tools

These are tools used for:

- Model registry: a centralized model store, with versioning capabilities
- Data/feature registry: a centralized store for training/validation data (and perhaps feature engineering)
- Experiment tracking and logging: record parameters, metrics, models and results
- Workflow orchestration: to facilitate continuous integration and deployment

A good set of tools should facilitate:
- Result analysis, model comparison and debugging during training and inference
- Reproducibility: efficiently package code, data and parameters for easily rerunning identical experiments
- Deployment and monitoring: deploy models using various serving infrastructure, and facilitate monitoring performance

Example tools: MLFlow, Kubeflow, Apache Airflow (workflow orchestration tool), AWS SageMaker, etc.
