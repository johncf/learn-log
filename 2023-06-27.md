### Choice of Loss Metric when Training a Model

Source: https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/470786/146083

When training/fitting model to some data, it is important to understand the various costs at play:
- **Prediction Cost**: This is the cost associated with errors that the model makes. This should be representative of how the negative impacts on the real world (e.g., monetary loss) grow with respect to prediction errors (e.g., quadratic growth).
- **Estimation Loss**: This controls how the model parameters are optimized. A data scientist is free to choose this function based on tractability and performance, but ideally, minimizing estimation loss should minimize prediction cost. A popular choice of estimation loss is mean squared error (MSE or Ordinary Least Squares, OLS), however note that MSE is not robust against outliers.
